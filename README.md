📊 Fitness Tracker Market Analysis – Storytelling EDA
📌 Project Overview

This project explores a dataset of fitness trackers to understand market trends, pricing strategies, customer feedback, and factors influencing product value. The analysis is presented as a story-driven exploratory data analysis aimed at deriving actionable insights rather than just visualizations.

🎯 Objective

Understand price distribution and discount strategies

Analyze customer ratings and reviews

Identify what makes a fitness tracker “good value”

Provide data-backed insights for product positioning

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains product-level information such as:

Brand and model

Selling and original prices

Device type and features

Ratings and number of reviews

Battery life and strap material

🧹 Data Cleaning Summary

Handled missing values in ratings and reviews

Converted price and count columns to appropriate numeric types

Removed duplicate records to ensure data consistency

📈 Key Insights

Most fitness trackers are concentrated in the low to mid-price range

Ratings are heavily clustered between 3.5–4.5, indicating rating inflation

Products with more reviews show more stable ratings

Discounts vary widely and provide better value indicators than price alone

Higher price does not guarantee higher customer satisfaction

📌 Tools Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Future Work

Build a value score combining price, rating, and reviews

Predict product ratings using machine learning

Segment products based on market positioning
